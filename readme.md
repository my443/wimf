# WIMF (What's In My Freezer)

A game where you build meals from your freezer before the food goes bad. 

## To build a meal: 

* Take items out of the freezer that are the same colour as the recipe in the top-left corner. 
* Tap on an item in the freezer to select it. 

## Your Challenge
* Each food item has a countdown clock to it's expiry. 
* If a food item expires, it causes the other items around to expire faster. 
* If you add an expired item to your meal, the whole meal is lost. 
* Every 14 days, your freezer is replenished with more food. (Days countdown is on the right-hand side.)

## Winning

* You advance to the next level if you go one year (52 weeks) without your freezer filling up with expired food. 
* If all of the food in your freezer expires, you lose the game.
